The Superstore Data Analysis Project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to extract valuable business insights and improve decision-making through data visualization and interactive dashboards. The goal is to identify sales trends, profitable regions, top-performing products, and customer behavior patterns.

The project follows a structured, six-phase workflow. In Phase 1, raw data is cleaned using Python, Pandas, and VS code to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types. Phase 2 involves creating a relational database schema and importing the cleaned dataset into MySQL workbench for efficient data storage and querying.

In Phase 3, SQL queries such as SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY are used to extract analytical insights on sales, profit, and quantity across categories, regions, and time periods. Phase 4 focuses on data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate charts, graphs, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for trend analysis.

Phase 5 involves building an interactive dashboard using Power BI and preparing presentation slides that summarize insights and recommendations. Finally, Phase 6 ensures comprehensive documentation, including all scripts, SQL queries, and reports, to maintain reproducibility and industry-level standards.

Overall, this project integrates Python, SQL, and Power BI to transform raw retail data into actionable intelligence, showcasing strong skills in data analytics, visualization, and business intelligence.
